## Introduction
Welcome to my Kickstarter Campaign Analysis repository. This project delves into the vibrant world of crowdfunding, where creativity meets financial backing, using the robust querying capabilities of SQL. Kickstarter, a leader in the crowdfunding domain, has seen an expansive array of projects, varying in success and scope across numerous categories and regions. Our objective is to dissect this wealth of data to uncover insights that could guide creators and backers towards more informed decisions.

Through the use of SQL, I systematically analyze campaign trends, success rates, and category performances to glean patterns and narratives that lie within the numbers. The queries range from basic data retrieval to complex joins, aggregations, and window functions, aiming to unravel the factors that contribute to a campaign's success or failure. Finally, I  utlized DAX to transform the dataset and create a dashboard in Power BI, to present the findings in an interactive and intuitive manner, allowing users to filter, sort, and explore the data in ways thta cater to their specific interests or investigative needs.

This analysis is not only a reflection of the current state of crowdfunding but also serves as a strategic tool for prospective project creators and investors. By understanding past and present trends, stakeholders can forecast future patterns and position their campaigns for optimal visibility and funding success.

We encourage you to explore the SQL scripts, contribute to the analysis, and share your unique findings as we collectively enhance our understanding of the Kickstarter ecosystem. Let's dive into the data and discover what stories lie beneath the surface of successful crowdfunding campaigns.

The original data sets, sourced from the Kickstarter [Open Data website](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats), encapsulates campaigns data from 2009 to 2017.
